  <p>Given the following statement, rewrite the case statement for MONDAY, FRIDAY, and SUNDAY as it would appear in a switch expression. It should fit on one line. Use arrow notation. </p> 
  <pre><code class="java">switch (day) {
        case MONDAY:
        case FRIDAY:
        case SUNDAY:
            numLetters = 6;
            break;
        case TUESDAY:
            numLetters = 7;
            break;
        case THURSDAY:
        case SATURDAY:
            numLetters = 8;
            break;
        case WEDNESDAY:
            numLetters = 9;
            break;
        default:
            throw new IllegalStateException("Invalid day: " + day);
    }</code></pre>
